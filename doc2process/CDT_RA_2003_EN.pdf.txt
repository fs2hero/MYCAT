ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 2
PREFACE 
The Translation Centre was officially set up in 1994; its work consists mainly in meeting the 
translation requirements of the other decentralised Community agencies, offices and bodies and 
participating in the activities of the Interinstitutional Committee for Translation and Interpreting, 
which seeks to promote cooperation among the different services. 
In the course of its existence, the Translation Centre has accumulated a solid base of know-how. 
I believe that its ability to accommodate the needs of a growing number of clients and to meet a 
demand which is both fluctuating and highly diverse confirm that the role accorded to the Centre 
on its creation was appropriate. 
The Activity Report for 2003 sets out activities in which the Translation Centre is engaged which 
are evidence of renewed impetus: 10 000 additional pages translated and diversification of the 
client portfolio, which has increased from 19 to 23. 
It also demonstrates the Translation Centre’s determination to be ready for the enlargement of 
the European Union. This is a major event since, like the other Community translation services, 
the Centre will be called upon to manage more or less twice as many official languages as it does 
at present. In many quarters, the new language structure, which comprises 20 languages and 
380 possible language combinations, is undoubtedly seen as an unprecedented challenge. 
The year 2003 also marks the firm establishment of the Translation Centre’s global quality 
initiative based on the European Foundation for Quality Management model. The first fruits of this 
commitment are the direct result of the enthusiasm and skills of all the staff of the Translation 
Centre. The Centre must now seek to sustain this approach over the long term with the same 
discerning regard which has characterised its strategy to date. 
I have now been asked to take on a new role as head of Eurostat and the time has therefore 
come for me to lay down my mandate as Chairman of the Management Board. I should like to 
take this opportunity to say how happy I have been to play a part in the development of this 
agency, for the benefit of Europe.
I should also like to give my successor, Karl-Johan Lönnroth, and all the members of staff my 
best wishes for success in the future.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION
Following the difficulties we had to overcome in 2002, due to the fall in our volume of work and the need 
to adjust rapidly to this unfavourable situation, we could class 2003 as the return to normality. Our 
volume of translation rose to 238 399 pages, i.e. an increase of 10 616 pages or 4.6% in comparison 
with the previous year. Although, undoubtedly, only a modest increase, it brings the negative chapter of 
2002 to an end and allows us to continue the successful development of the Centre's activities. 
Detailed analysis of the figures which appear in the statistics annexed to this report reveals some even 
more positive aspects of this development when compared to previous years, since although the total 
number of pages of Community trademarks translated for the Office for Harmonization in the Internal 
Market (OHIM) fell slightly, from 147 388 pages in 2002 to 142 021 pages in 2003 (i.e. 5 367 pages or 
3.6%), the translation of documents increased considerably, from 80 395 pages in 2002 to 
95 824 pages in 2003, i.e. an additional 15 429 pages, which amounts to an increase of 19% in this type 
of translations.

This latest evidence of the Centre’s already proven ability to offset the fall in demand from some clients 
with increases in demand from others is coupled with a further positive element, namely the 
implementation by the Centre of a translation system corresponding to the completely new registration 
system for Community designs at the OHIM. Despite the modest figures for this first year for the 
translation of designs (554 pages), this industrial property registration system is set to take off rapidly 
considering the advantages it offers applicants in the way way of quick registration, simplified 
procedures and reduced costs. The Centre has made considerable efforts to organise its services so as 
to be able to meet the high expectations of the OHIM regarding its new registration system for 
Community designs.

CHAPTER 2 
MANAGEMENT BOARD 
A. OPERATION
The Translation Centre’s supervisory body, its Management Board, comprises one representative 
from each Member State, one representative from each institution and body that has concluded 
an agreement for collaboration with the Centre, and two representatives from the European 
Commission, i.e. a total of 39 full members. The list of members by name appears in Annex I to 
this report. 
The Management Board met twice: on 27 March and 30 October. During this last meeting, it also 
decided to give its opinion, through a written procedure, on certain draft texts in the financial and 
budgetary field, particularly due to the need to obtain the European Commission’s opinion in the 
consultation on these matters. 
B. DECISIONS AND GUIDELINES
The Management Board approved the drafts presented by the Centre, namely: 
1. In the financial and budgetary field 
� Opinion of the Management Board on the implementation of the budget for 2001 (meeting of 
27 March). 
� Amending budget for 2003 (written procedure of 5 December). 
� Budget for 2004 (meeting of 30 October). 
� Financial Regulation applicable to the Centre (written procedure of 5 December). 
� Regulation establishing the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation of the Translation 
Centre (written procedure of 5 December). 
2. General 
� Activity Report for 2002: the Management Board adopted the draft presented by the Director 
and recommended that the Centre analyse all appropriate strategies for dealing with the 
changes in demand of its clients and for maintaining a suitable relationship between support 
staff and translation staff (meeting of 27 March). 
� Work Programme for 2003: the Management Board adopted the draft and accompanied this 
with a request for the Centre to prepare a strategic document for the 2004/2005 period 
(meeting of 27 March). 
� Centre’s strategy for the 2004/2005 period: the Management Board gave its agreement in 
principle as formal adoption was not appropriate (meeting of 30 October).

C. KEY AREAS
1. Situation regarding the Centre’s premises 
The Management Board again considered the issue of the Centre’s permanent accommodation 
during its two meetings. Based on the offer of 24 March made by the Luxembourg authorities with 
regard to the cost of the lease-purchase of the Hamm building, it considered that this project was 
too expensive and did not meet the Centre’s needs in the short term, given the uncertainty 
affecting both funding and the development of the Centre’s activities. It therefore decided to take 
the following approach: to retain, as a guideline for the future, the principle of a purchase or 
lease-purchase and to consider housing the Centre within the Hemicycle for a term of three years 
which could be renewed. 
This last point was the subject of a number of exchanges with the Luxembourg authorities who 
submitted a draft lease contract in July. These negotiations did not, however, come to a 
successful conclusion. The Centre indicated that it could not agree to this due to the high price, a 
new demand made by the Luxembourg authorities regarding the previous accommodation and, 
finally, the problem posed by the retroactive nature of the effective date requested for the draft 
lease contract (1 January 2003). 
During its meeting of 30 October, the Management Board accepted the Luxembourg 
representative’s request to speed up the negotiations so that agreement could be rapidly reached 
on this issue and confirmed the mandate of its Chair in this respect. However, it highlighted the 
need, in this search for a compromise, to bear in mind the rules of sound financial management 
imposed on all Community bodies and also the need to take account, in the negotiation process, 
of the time-limit imposed by the provisions of Article 13(8) of the Centre’s amended Regulation 
providing for the notification to the budgetary authority of any projects relating to property and 
their information to the Commission. 
2. Amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board 
This reform was begun in 2002 by the Management Board with the aim of clarifying and making 
more flexible certain provisions of the applicable text. It instructed the Centre to this end. A draft 
text was prepared by the Centre following a written consultation of the members. Presented 
initially in March, for information purposes, in order to allow sufficient analysis time, the draft 
Regulation amending the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board was adopted in October. 
This Regulation introduces new provisions to ensure that the Management Board operates 
efficiently and to take account of the increase in the number of official languages as of 
1 May 2004, given the impact of this on the management and cost of translations for each 
meeting.

CHAPTER 3 
QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
The highlight of the first half of 2003 was the formal recognition by the EFQM (European Foundation 
for Quality Management) that the Centre is committed to excellence. To achieve this, the Centre had 
to complete three tasks identified as priority areas for improvement at its self-assessment workshop 
in June 2002: 
� clarify the Centre’s vision and strategy; 
� define and map key processes; 
� establish a performance and perception indicator framework. 
This work resulted in three documents: the Centre’s Strategic Plan for 2003-2008, the Process Map 
and the Balanced Scorecard. These documents have become the foundation stones for the Centre’s 
subsequent improvement actions and they ensure all activities contribute in a logical way to the 
fulfilment of its mission and vision. 
The Centre began its “Global quality management” project in January this year, with the help of an 
external consultant. After initially planning the main phases involved, it held a series of seven 
meetings to inform all staff members of the two-year project and its outline plan. To encourage team 
spirit across the Centre, every manager took part in conducting one of these meetings and the 
participants were in each case from all departments or services. 
In February all managers except the Director and heads of department met to prepare a “pre-
strategy” document which would be used subsequently by the top management team. The outcome 
was an assessment of the Centre’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, a framework 
for its vision and values and a draft strategic map. This document was then discussed within sections 
and departments and adapted according to suggestions from the staff. The Director and heads of 
department then met on 3 April to adopt the Strategic Plan and to prepare a set of operational 
objectives to guide its implementation. These objectives and accompanying measures became the 
Balanced Scorecard. 
The Strategic Plan was presented formally to staff at a general meeting on 3 June. 
In June, the Process Map and the Strategic Plan together served as the basis for selecting the 
processes deemed to be critical to the success of the Centre’s strategy (so-called “key processes”). 
Twelve processes in total were chosen for analysis and improvement, from all the Centre’s 
departments or services: 
� Choosing a supplier by a call for tenders 
� Upgrading an internal language tool 
� Translating a Community trademark or design 
� Helpdesk
� Translating a document 
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003

ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003
� Piloting translation activities 
� Providing instructions relating to a translation 
� Providing reference material (2 different processes) 
� Providing terminological support on request 
� Managing a project to develop a new language tool 
� Managing the development of skills 
According to the programme for this work, the first five processes were analysed in the second half 
of 2003. To do this, working parties of the people involved in each activity met periodically to define 
inputs, outputs, who does what, analyse the risks and establish improvement plans. The remaining 
analyses are planned for the first half of 2004. Furthermore, on the recommendation of the Court of 
Auditors, one or more processes relating to financial transactions should also be analysed. 
In parallel with this technical work, the Quality Management Section organised a special project 
aimed at developing communication within the Centre and making proposals to increase the overall 
efficiency of the Centre’s work. Under the guidance of a specialised external consultant, two working 
parties were formed: one at management level, the other operational. À number of proposals were 
made for further examination.

CHAPTER 4 
TRANSLATION AND RELATED ACTIVITIES 
A. WORKLOAD
1. Development in activity 
The annual number of pages translated rose to 238 399 pages, broken down as follows: 
� Documents: 95 824 pages of which 11 914 were in the languages of the candidate countries 
and 5 358 in other non-official languages. 
� Community trademarks and designs: 142 575 pages. 
The details on how the volume of activity is divided by client appear in Annex II to this report. 
The forecasts for the translation of documents into the languages of the candidate countries 
(Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovakian, Slovene, Czech and Maltese), 
namely 8 000 pages, were largely borne out: 11 914 pages. The increase is clearly explained by 
the fact that many of the Centre’s clients are still preparing for 1 May 2004 when these languages 
will become official languages of the European Union. A comparative analysis for 2002/2003 of 
the distribution per language appears in Annex III. 
For comparative purposes, the following table shows the development in activity since the Centre 
began operations: 
YEAR TOTAL PAGES CHANGE CHANGE
IN NUMBER OF PAGES IN % 
1995 20 204 / / 
1996 40 899 + 20 695 + 102.4

2002 227 783 - 60 152 - 20.9 
2003 238 399 + 10 616 + 4.6 
With a total of 26 collaboration agreements in force, four of these are new agreements concluded 
in 2003. These arrangements were signed with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), 
European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Commission’s 
Directorates-General (DG) for Employment and Enlargement. 
The activity in 2003 was characterised by other specific issues such as the translation, from the 
end of April, of Community designs for the OHIM and also the translation, at the request of the 
Council of the European Union, of the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into the 
10
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 10
languages of the candidate countries and also Turkish, Romanian and Bulgarian. These texts 
were revised by the Translation Coordination Units of the countries in question. 
2. Internal organisation and support activities 
� At the end of 2003 the Translation Department was reorganised. This specifically resulted in 
the External Translation Section being integrated with the Central Planning Section and an 
Internal Translation Group being created to carry out support activities such as document 
management, formatting and reference document management. 
� External Translation 
A total volume of 4 009 documents, i.e. a total of 55 815 pages of translation, was handled by 
the External Translation Section. The latter participated actively in the preparatory stages for 
enlargement (calls for tender, selection of external translators, etc.) which are detailed in 
Point C of this chapter. 
� Technical support
FlosysWeb, a system for registering translation requests from the Centre’s clients, was 
integrated into the document workflow at the beginning of 2003. This system was also the 
subject of a satisfaction survey among the Centre’s clients. Based on an in-depth analysis of 
comments made by various participants, areas for improvement were defined. An initial set of 
changes to the existing functions was implemented in the autumn. Some adaptations require 
more extensive IT developments and will be integrated within a new FlosysWeb version to be 
operational at the beginning of 2004. These particularly involve improvements to the request 
input interface and the integration of a multi-user request management system. 
The development of new modules, such as the management of research files, analysis by 
CAT (computer-assisted translation) of an original document, and the cross-check function 
were finalised in the second half of 2003. 
� Terminology
Terminology work focused more and more on the integration of the Centre’s terminology 
resources in the interinstitutional terminology database IATE (which stands for Inter Active 
Terminology for Europe). IATE, which will be accessible to the general public, will become a 
direct and immediate way of providing terminology to external translators in 2004. 
The terminology group continued its work with semi-automatic terminology extraction. This 
software allows for the creation of multilingual glossaries from large text corpora in a relatively 
short time. Today, the approach is well mastered and several smaller projects allowed to 
establish the procedures necessary to use this technology efficiently in an operational 
situation.
B. RELATIONS WITH CLIENTS
Regular contact has been made with each of the Centre’s clients. This has allowed their 
immediate and future needs in terms of the imminent enlargement to be better defined. At the 
same time, the coordinators (a coordinator is appointed for each client), who particularly deal with 
linguistic questions in documents sent for translation, have carried out background work in liaison 
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
11
11 ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003
with each institution/agency/body in order to obtain as much information as possible allowing 
quality work to be ensured. 
Early in 2003 discussions with several agencies showed a growing interest in the usage of 
Extended Mark-up Language (.xml) in the document production process. This neutral standard 
format gives a high degree of control and flexibility. Its usage for both authoring and translation 
was discussed in meetings between the Centre, EEA, EMEA and EFIL. D’ores et déjà, le Centre 
produit de tels formats à la demande d’EFIL, du CEDEFOP et d’Europol. Besides that, an 
exchange of views on authoring tools and the potential of standardisation of agency specific 
terminology was initiated in 2003. 
Client satisfaction form (CSF): Client feedback is a key element in the quality improvement cycle. 
The Centre sends an electronic “client satisfaction form” automatically with every translation job 
provided, so that it can be forwarded to the end user with a minimum of effort. Out of 13.374 
translations delivered in 2003, 107 forms were returned (0.8 % of the total number of 
translations). Of these, 0.3 % were positive and 0.4 % expressed some dissatisfaction (five forms 
were neither positive nor negative. The main problem areas were terminology and style. To 
address the former, the Centre extracts any terminology corrected by the client and enters it in 
the Trados MultiTerm database, Euroterms that will be imported into the Interinstitutional 
terminology database, IATE, in 2004.) As regards the style problems, sometimes these are a 
matter of taste, sometimes they are attributable to a very short deadline, and sometimes they are 
related to the source text. In any case, the feedback is thoroughly and analysed by our Quality 
Management Section and the people concerned. 
C. ACTIVITIES LINKED TO THE FUTURE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
1. PHARE programme 
In 2003 the Translation Centre obtained funding from the PHARE programme of the European 
Commission for a project aimed at preparing the Centre for the enlargement of the Eurpean 
Union in 2004. PHARE’s "Multi-beneficiary program on Participation of the Central and Eastern 
Europe Candidate Countries (CEECs) in Community Agencies in 2002 and 2003" allowed the 
Translation Centre to set up a project (a) to inform professionals of the language trade in the 
accession countries of the activities of the Translation Centre and (b) to get an overview of the 
translation market in these countries. 
Presentations of the Centre’s activities were organised in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Czech 
Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia. The target audience were students of 
translation and related fields, representatives of translation services of the national authorities 
and freelance translators. The presentations focused on the following points: 
� The role of the Centre; 
� Community Agencies of the European Union; 
� Working methods of the Translation at the Centre; 
� Translation Technology at the Centre; 
� Working for the Centre: recruitment, external translation and traineeships. 
As part of this project a new section on "Enlargement" was added to the Centre’s web site that 
contains information targeted to linguists in the acceding countries.

2. Nemo 
In view of the imminent enlargement of the European Union, the translation memory system for 
the translation of Community trademarks and Community designs Nemo had to be prepared to 
accommodate 9 new languages. The task implied adding and developing a number of features to 
be able to process and translate batches of trademarks into 19 languages without losing out on 
performance. Time being an extremely important factor in the regular processing cycle, and 
deadlines being as tight as they can be, it was clear that the pre-processing of the files, actually 
done over the weekend to avoid using precious resources during normal working hours, could not 
be allowed to exceed the actually allotted amount of time. With definitive tests and “real life” 
experience still to prove the preliminary results, the challenge of handling almost double the 
number of languages at the same time was solved after a thorough analysis of the individual 
elements of the system, their enhancement in terms of efficiency and productivity and the 
upgrade of other components to reflect state-of-the-art versions. The Centre expects to have a 
fully equipped and effective version 3 of Nemo by the end of February 2004. 
3. Calls for tender and external translators 
Another very important activity related to enlargement was the selection of external translators most 
suited to the needs of clients. In addition to using the lists resulting from the calls for expressions of 
interest organised by the European Commission, the Centre analysed all spontaneous applications 
received, and also the lists of translators published by the translators’ associations in these countries, 
in order to select those translators most capable of meeting the specific requirements of the 
translation work for the Centre’s various clients, including in specialist fields. The Centre now has a 
network of translators for these languages. However, it should be noted that the coverage of source 
languages is very often limited to English and, to a lesser degree, German. Real problems therefore 
exist in finding translators who can provide  translations from French. 
Based on surveys conducted among clients in order to define their translation needs from and to the 
new languages, the Centre published several calls for tender: in the medical field (into the new 
languages and into Norwegian and Icelandic) and for the translation of Community trademarks (into 
the new languages), and also a call for expressions of interest for the following languages: Bulgarian, 
Romanian and Turkish. 
4. Auxiliary translators 
On 1 October 2003, the Centre welcomed the first translators for the new languages, i.e. Estonian, 
Hungarian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Slovakian and Slovenian. A Maltese translator started work 
on 16 November so that, together with a Czech translator who will start on 1 January 2004, the team 
will then be complete. 
Enthusiastic preparations have been made by everyone in all departments for this important moment 
for the new translators and for the Centre. The integration of the new translators has gone very well, 
thanks to the general willingness of everyone to do their best.

CHAPTER 5 
RELATIONS WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BODIES 
A. INTERINSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITIES
1. Interinstitutional Committee for Translation and Interpretation (ICTI) 
The meetings of the Interinstitutional Committee for Translation and Interpretation, that bring together 
the managing staff of the translation and interpretation services of EU institutions and the Translation 
Centre, were to a large extend dedicated to the preparation of the linguistic services for the 
enlargement of the Union in 2004. The ICTI closely followed the progress of the recruitment 
procedures for auxiliary translators and interpreters for the nine languages of the acceding countries. 
This major recruitment effort was – for the first time — organised centrally by the European 
Communities Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). The forum of the ICTI meetings was used several 
times to communicate the requirements of the linguistic services to the representatives of EPSO. 
Besides that, the ICTI members exchanged information on a number of issues related to the 
enlargement and tried to anticipate potential problems (e.g. lack of specific language training or the 
relatively limited number of qualified freelance translators in some candidate countries). 
Other matters treated by the ICTI include: 
� On request of the Secretaries General the ICTI launched an external study on the potential 
optimisation of the cooperation between the translation services. The study focuses on the 
European Commission, Council, Parliament and the Economic and Social 
Committee/Committee of the Regions. À final report is expected during the first semester 
2004.
� The committee decided on the administrative structures and the budget requirements for the 
interinstitutional terminology database IATE, thus ensuring a swift transition of the project to its 
operational phase in 2004. 
2. The work of the coordinating cells 
a. Coordinating Cell on Support for Translation and Interpretation 
As in 2002 the Centre chaired the Coordinating Cell on Support for Translation and Interpretation. 
The group met on a 4 to 6 week basis in this period to discuss the usage of computer tools in the 
translation process. Three main project should be mentioned here in more detail: 
� On behalf of the other services the Council continued negotiations with the company Scansoft 
on the acquisition of speech recognition software (Dragon Naturally Speaking). The results of 
this procedure are expected in the fourth quarter 2003. The Translation Centre plans to 
introduce this technology in all its departments in 2004. 
� The Coordinating Cell continued work on a call for tender for the prospecting of the market 
and the acquisition of various support tools for translators. An information notice was  
14
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 14
published in April 2003 in the Official Journal. The publication of the call for tender itself is 
scheduled for the first quarter 2004. The call will cover the following items: 
�Translation memory software and sentence alignment programs. 
�Software for the automatic extraction of terminology. 
�Speech recognition software, namely for languages not covered by Dragon Naturally 
Speaking.
� The Coordinating Cell reviewed the final version of the feasibility study on interinstitutional 
access to the Euramis system of the European Commission. Euramis offers a number of 
linguistic services, like large scale translation memories and automatic look-up of references 
to the Celex database of legal texts. The Coordinating Cell supported the conclusions of the 
feasibility study and recommended the creation of an interinstitutional Euramis portal. 
b. Coordinating Cell on External Translation 
The activity of this Coordinating Cell basically involved: 
� Organisation and monitoring of calls for tender for translation services into the languages of 
the candidate countries undertaken by the European Parliament (lead body) in association 
with the Centre, Commission, Economic and Social Committee/Committee of the Regions and 
Court of Auditors. 
� Reform of the Interinstitutional Committee for the Evaluation of Quality (CIEQ), firstly to meet 
the needs of enlargement and secondly to make subsequent economies of scale. 
c. Coordinating Cell on Internal Translation 
This Coordinating Cell met five times. One of the main areas of its work concerns statistics on 
staff and the provision of translation services in the European Union. A project based on common 
criteria was developed with the approval of all the members. Among the other issues discussed, 
the following should be noted: recruitment of translators for the future new official languages and 
quality assurance methods. 
B. PROJECTS UNDERWAY WITH PARTNERS:IATE
The development phase of the interinstitutional terminology database IATE ended in the second 
quarter 2003 with the acceptance of the IATE system by an inter-institutional work group. The 
terminological data of the participating services (i.e. European Commission, Parliament, Council, 
Court of Auditors, Court of Justice and Centre) have been loaded into one common database. IATE 
offers a number of user interfaces for the retrieval, modification and creation of terminological 
information.
After the migration of the system to a production server at the Data Centre of the European 
Commission in Luxembourg large scale user tests will be carried out. According to the project plan 
the operational phase of IATE can begin in the first quarter 2004. 
The ICTI asked the Centre to take over the project management of IATE. A "Support and 
Development" team was set up at the Centre to ensure support and day-to-day maintenance.
Besides that, two interinstitutional work groups were created to follow up on technical issues and on 
questions related to the contents of the database.

CHAPTER 6 
THE CENTRE’S OPERATION 
A.  HUMAN RESOURCES AND ADMINISTRATION
1.  Staff management activities  
As at 31 December, the Centre’s staff consisted of a total of 147 temporary staff, auxiliary staff 
and officials, i.e. an increase of around 5% compared with 2002. Total staff turnover, regardless 
of reason for leaving or status, was close to 9%. The distribution of staff by nationality, age, sex 
and category is detailed in Annex VII. 
Among the events marking 2003 was the arrival of the first translators into the languages of the 
candidate countries (eight in total). To recruit these auxiliary staff, the Centre relied on a selection 
process organised at interinstitutional level. 
The acceptance of trainees also represented a first. The applicants were selected by an 
assessment committee following the publication of a call for applications on the Centre’s Internet 
site. Taken on for a period of four months and accompanied during their stay by a supervisor, 
they carry out their traineeship within the Translation Department and participate in translation 
and terminology work. 
Among the other activities carried out during the year were the continuation of the establishment 
procedures (two established posts), the preparation of an installation guide aimed at helping new 
colleagues to integrate and an annual training plan, together with the production of job 
descriptions which will eventually cover all existing jobs. These descriptions will allow the Centre 
to gradually equip itself with a proper human resources management tool. The reform of the Staff 
Regulations, which is currently in progress, has been closely monitored given its impact on staff 
management. In addition to participating in numerous meetings organised by the European 
Commission on this issue, the Centre also took part, as representative of the agencies, in the 
meetings of the Staff Regulations Committee. 
2. Administrative management activities 
As far as the building situation is concerned, various operations were carried out such as: 
development of the new office area on level + 1a of the Hemicycle, alteration of the emergency 
door and escape route signs to bring them back into compliance and temporary lease of parking 
spaces following a search undertaken due to increasing difficulties encountered at the site by 
staff. The issue of the Centre’s permanent headquarters was particularly monitored given the 
developments in this matter as described in Chapter 2 Point C of this report. One of the main 
achievements of the Security Office was the introduction of a visitor registration and monitoring 
system.
16
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 16
B.  FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT
1.  Financial and accounting activities 
Pursuant to Article 185 of the general Financial Regulation, the Centre developed a draft 
Financial Regulation and also draft Implementing Rules, based on the framework Financial 
Regulation for Community bodies. This draft was the subject of Opinion No 4/2003 of the Court of 
Auditors of 10 June 2003. In this Opinion, the Court approved the wording of Article 8 
(non-differentiated nature of appropriations) as proposed by the Centre and suggested adding 
certain provisions to this Regulation which the Centre had planned to include within the 
Implementing Rules. The Centre made these amendments to its draft. 
As regards the Commission’s opinion (DG Budget), an interservice consultation was launched on 
7 October 2003 on the provisions of Article 59(3) (permanent prefinancing fund) of the draft. The 
Commission gave its agreement to this provision on 21 November 2003. The Centre’s draft 
Financial Regulation and the draft Regulation establishing the Implementing Rules were approved 
by the Management Board through a written procedure on 22 December. 
The entry into force of the framework Financial Regulation requires major changes to be made to 
the Centre’s financial management systems, given the disappearance of the financial control and 
the creation of two new roles, initiator and verifier. These new financial systems will become fully 
operational in 2004. The budget accounting system, SI2, was updated with a version based on 
the new Financial Regulation. Finally, since 1 January 2003, translation work has been invoiced 
on a monthly basis rather than quarterly. 
2.  Legal activities 
The implementation of the new Financial Regulation and, with regard to the roles of those 
involved, the reform of the financial management accompanied by the removal of centralised 
ex ante controls have added to the responsibilities of authorising officers for all revenue and 
expenditure transactions, including in terms of internal control systems. Therefore, information 
meetings for those involved in the area of contract awarding have taken place. 
The main calls for tender launched concerned the provision of translation services for 
standardised technical texts in the field of industrial/intellectual property, the provision of 
translation services from English into Russian and vice versa and the provision of translation 
and/or revision services for medical and pharmaceutical texts. 
In the context of interinstitutional cooperation, the Centre became involved with call for tender 
procedures launched by the European Parliament to provide translation services from and to the 
languages of the candidate countries. It also participated in various call for tender procedures 
launched by the European Commission such as, for example, the call for tenders regarding 
travel/mission agencies. 
As regards the cooperation agreements governing the relations of the institutions and bodies with 
the Centre, 14 were renewed during the year and four new arrangements were signed.

ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003
C. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
For the Computer Department, 2003 was marked by an increase in the central server capacity, 
the installation of a new version of the Centre’s operating systems and office tools, the 
replacement of laptop computers and the installation of new inventory software and the version of 
the SI2 financial software corresponding to the new Financial Regulation. This was also a key 
phase in the technical preparation for the future enlargement of the Union. 
1. Hardware/software 
Seven new Intel technology quadri-processor servers were installed to replace and supplement 
the existing central equipment. These will allow the processing and storage capacity of the Nemo 
(Community trademarks and designs) and Flosys (documents) applications which use the Oracle 
databases to be increased. Eight other low-power servers (single-processor) were installed to 
replace the PC servers. For security and space-saving reasons, all this new equipment was 
integrated into racks. The servers were installed based on the Windows 2000 server operating 
system which is newer and more powerful than the Windows NT version which will soon no 
longer be maintained by Microsoft and which does not support the new generation hardware. 
All the Centre’s workstations were completely reinstalled in order to replace the Windows NT 
operating system with Windows XP and its Office XP software suite. This includes 85 items of 
software, of which 37 are electronic dictionaries and encyclopaedias which have been updated 
and adapted. These versions offer new functions and are more user-friendly and powerful when 
installed on the latest generation of hardware. For example, the additional multilingual support 
functions will assist in the integration of the new languages which in some cases require very 
special fonts. 
In order to allow everyone in the Centre to familiarise themselves with and optimise their use of 
the new functions in these latest software versions, all the Centre’s staff attended one of the 
13 training sessions prepared and run by the Computer Department for this purpose. 
2. Telecommunications 
A secure service allowing Centre staff whose job requires this to access their e-mails over the 
Internet was installed. This is accessible both over the Internet and through a direct connection 
made from a laptop computer via an international freephone number. 
A new access to the European Commission allows the staff concerned to use the New Payroll 
System (NAP) through the Centre’s IT network. 
3. Development activities 
The ELS inventory management software was disabled and replaced by the Isiparc product. The 
inventory reports produced using the Business Object reporting tool were redeveloped and 
adapted to the new product. 
The FlosysWeb system for submitting translation requests via an Internet interface was installed. 
This allows the Centre’s clients to submit their translation work directly via the Internet. After four  
18
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 18
months of use by the various agencies, this system was the subject of a satisfaction survey 
among users. The analysis of responses allowed the user-friendliness of the system to be 
improved through various adaptations and new functions will be proposed in 2004. 
In order to implement the new Financial Regulation, a new version of the SI2 budget 
management system had to be installed. All the applications developed by the Centre and linked 
to this software therefore had to be adapted and new functions were also added. Therefore, the 
introduction of the electronic signature of order forms sent to external translators has allowed the 
handling and production of paper documents and use of the fax to be significantly reduced. 
The applications developed by the Centre for managing documents to be translated (Flosys), staff 
and calls for tender and also for statistical reporting were adapted to the new technical platform 
and have benefited from additional functions. 
A new version of the Nemo application for managing Community trademarks and designs was 
installed. Besides adding new functions, this version has allowed the application to be installed on 
a new more powerful technical platform. This will allow the next version integrating the new 
languages due to enlargement to be installed under optimum conditions. 
The pilot phase of the electronic document management project came to an end. The 
development of a small application for processing purchasing files allowed the various options 
offered by the technical base chosen to be evaluated and the cost of developing new functions to 
be estimated. 
4. Activities linked to the future enlargement of the European Union 
The main technical resources allowing additional volumes of data linked to enlargement to be 
stored and processed are in place. This will allow the storage of the new documents and 
additional information which will be added to the various translation work management 
applications (Suivi, Demandes, Statistics, Nemo) and also the installation of additional translation 
tools such as dictionaries, reference bases and translation memory or machine translation data. 
Additional workstations needed by the translators in order to handle the future new official 
languages are operational and the fonts and corresponding keyboards have been installed. 
The new version of the Windows XP operating system, which allows multilingualism to be 
integrated more easily, has been installed and has allowed the software versions which can 
support the new languages to be updated.

2. Internet sites 
a. www.cdt.eu.int 
With 155 234 recorded hits, the Centre’s general-interest site has without question seen an 
increase in visitor frequency since its creation at the end of 1999. The efforts made to add to 
and diversify the information offered (creation of new Traineeship and Enlargement sections) 
therefore seem to be bearing fruit. 2003 also confirmed the trend seen in previous years of a 
marked interest of visitors to the Job Offers, Call for Tenders and Documentation pages. 
At the same time as the work to update and expand the site, a technical analysis was carried 
out which must be used as the basis for the functional and conceptual adaptations planned for 
2004.
b. www.freelance.cdt.eu.int 
Specifically for external translators under contract to the Centre, this site is only accessible by 
password. It has been expanded with new information. Therefore, the lists resulting from calls 
for tender can now be consulted on line. Thanks to twice-monthly updates, contractors can 
precisely find out their rating. In addition, work has started on making standard reference 
documents available on line. 
3. Other operations 
a. Public relations  
The Centre organises fact-finding visits on a regular basis at the request of other 
institutions/bodies, universities, etc. Visitors are mainly those whose activity is directly related 
to translation: translators, terminologists, trainee linguists, etc. 
20
ACTIVITYREPORT FOR 2003
ACTIVITY REPORT FOR 2003 20
The aim is to ensure as broad a distribution as possible of the Centre’s publications, either 
through the list of names or via its Internet site. As regards its public relations, the Centre is 
also required to respond to information or document requests which it receives. In this respect, 
the Centre’s e-mail address (cdt@cdt.eu.int) plays a significant role as nearly all requests are 
made through this. Increasing use of this method of communication for sending spontaneous 
applications and traineeship requests has also been seen (78% of all applications recorded by 
the Centre in 2003). 
b. Seminar 
As it was responsible for coordinating the Community agencies in 2003, the Centre organised, 
during the Directors’ meeting held on 31 October in Luxembourg, a seminar entitled 
Rencontre autour de la traduction. At this seminar, it presented its approach to the criteria in 
the �quality, price, deadline� triangle with regard to providing linguistic products as quickly and 
accurately as possible and at the best cost. The following themes were developed by the 
Centre’s various speakers: The human factor � what it means to translate; Outsourcing 
without tears; A holistic approach to quality management; Technology: opportunities and 
limitations. This seminar also allowed the Centre’s publication Writing for translation to be 
presented. This work is specifically aimed at authors of texts in the European Union’s 
agencies which are intended for translation and gives advice on how to structure these texts to 
make them more concise, clearer and easier to read. It is based on a Swedish document 
entitled Tala för att tolkas. Skriva för att översättas, published by the Services of the Swedish 
Government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is itself a translation and adaptation of the 
Finnish guide entitled Käännetäänkö tekstisi, tulkataanko puheenvuorosi?, written to celebrate 
the Finnish presidency of the Union during the second half of 1999. This initiative by the 
Centre was received with real interest by participants.
